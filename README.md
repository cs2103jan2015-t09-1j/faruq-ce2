# Faruq CE2

For your reference.

Basically the steps involved:

1. Refactor CE1 to use an architecture - separate it into components.
2. The components should inherit a base class or implement a base interface. (i.e. UI -> 
UIMainImpl)
3. Once the components are clearly segrated, can begin crafting Unit Tests.
4. In unit tests, we swap the real implementation of the things we are not testing with stub 
classes.
5. Refer to JUnitTextBuddyAtd.java for my unit tests.

## Components

1. UI
2. Controller
3. Data
